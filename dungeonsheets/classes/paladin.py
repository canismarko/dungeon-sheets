    warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
    acting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater good. They hold
    themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or
    worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear
    this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as
    the measure o f their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants o f
    good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their
    helmets or coats of arms.

    **Tenets of Devotion**: Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath
    of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

    --Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

    --Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

    --Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten
    them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

    --Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an
    example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount
    of harm.

    --Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect
    those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over
    you.

    paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in
    the cosm ic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and
    life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in
    principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and
    clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to
    reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world. 

    **Tenets of the Ancients**: The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have
      been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the
      principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central
      principles are simple.

    --Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness,
    kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

    --Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the
    world, stand against the w ickedness that would swallow it. Where life
    flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.

    --Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and
    art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it
    in the world.

    --Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the
    light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

    when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves'
    guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the
    countryside-at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of
    Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins-
    sometimes called avengers or dark knights-their own purity is not as
    important as delivering justice.

    **Tenets of Vengance**: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by
    paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any
    means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice
    even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so
    the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core
    principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

    --Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or
    combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.

    --No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn
    enemies do not.

    --By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating

    society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These
    paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the

    the following tenets.

    civilization together, and it must be respected.

    knight ty- rants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into
    grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.

    Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine
    Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel,
    warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins-called hell knights-as
    his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies
    taken from fallen en- emies, a grim~warning to any who dare oppose them and
    the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted
    by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have
    wandered too far into darkness.

    **Tenets of Conquest**: A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of
    conquest seared on the upper arm.

    --Douse the Flame of Hope. It is not enough
    to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so over- whelming
    that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a
    life. Fear can end an empire.

    dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who
    defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.

    a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate
    themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that
    the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These
    paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the
    light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save
    other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.

    While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Re- deemers know that
    undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently
    evil. Against such fees, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath
    of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the re- deemers still pray that,
    one day, even creatures of wick- edness will invite their own redemption.

    **Tenets of Redemption**: The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a
    paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.

    --Peace. Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding
    are the paths to long-lasting peace.

    --Innocence. All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their
    environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By
    setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply
    flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.

    --Patience. Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked
    must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted
    the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to
    allow that seed to survive and flourish.

    --Wisdom. Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be
    forced to admit defeat. While ev- ery creature can be redeemed, some are so
    far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives
    for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the
    consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow
    through with it knowing your path is just.
