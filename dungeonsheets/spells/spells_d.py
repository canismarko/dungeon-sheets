    nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.
    
    Grasping Undergrowth. You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground 
    that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were 
    affected by an entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds 
    and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.
    
    Grove Guardians. You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to 
    uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an 
    awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can't speak, and
     their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this 
    effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven 
    off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands 
    (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. Ifyou don't give 
    them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The

     within the warded area: 
    - A constant gust of Wind in two locations of your 
    choice
    - Spike growth in one location of your choice
    - Wind wall in two 
    locations of your choice
