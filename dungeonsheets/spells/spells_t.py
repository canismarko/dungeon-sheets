    Familiarity.
    "Permanent circle" means a permanent 
    teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means 
    that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last 
    six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal 
    suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.
    "Very familiar" is a 
    place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place 
    you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen 
    more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place
     you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose 
    location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps 
    from a map.
    "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried
     to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are 
    attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
    
    On Target
    
    You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
    
    Off Target
    
    You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the
     destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent 
    of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120
     miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would 
    be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off 
    target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as
     east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a 
    coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
    
    Similar
     Area
    You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area 
    that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading 
    for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's 
    laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and 
    implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar 
    place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up 
    anywhere on the plane.
    
    Mishap
    The spell's unpredictable magic results in a 
    difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 
    force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple
     mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

    pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
    
    You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The interior is enclosed 
    by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and
     as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you 
    cast the spell can open or close the door.
    The temple's interior is an open 
    space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is 
    illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The 
    smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.
    The 
    temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose 
    one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If
     a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must 
    make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24
     hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; 
    whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the
     temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.

    modifier (minimum 1 hit point).

    you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind 
    you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its 
    level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game 
    statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of 
    the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
    The target assumes the 
    hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature
     returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts
     as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its 
    normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal 
    form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

    the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, 
    cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its 
    new form is capable of such actions.

    You can turn an object into any kind of

    and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it 
    takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of
     its actions and movement.

     the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have 
    treated it.

    If you turn a creature into an object, it 
    transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The 
    creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory
     of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal
