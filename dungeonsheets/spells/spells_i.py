    this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't 
    age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.
    
    When you cast the 
    spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment. 
    
    Burial
    The 
    target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is 
    just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the 
    sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of
     it.
    The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
    
    
    Chaining
    Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. 
    The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by 
    any means until then.
    The special component for this version of the spell is 
    a fine chain of precious metal.
    
    Hedged Prison
    The spell transports the target 
    into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. 
    The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined 
    structure or area of your choice.
    The special component for this version of the 
    spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
    
    Minimus 
    Containment
    The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a 
    gemstone or similarobject. Light can pass through the gemstone 
    normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but 
    nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. 
    The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.
    The 
    special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent 
    gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
    
    Slumber
    The target falls asleep
     and can't be awoken.
    The special component for this version of the 
    spell consists of rare soporific herbs. 
    
    Ending the Spell
    During the casting of
     the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause 
    the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as 
    elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable 
    and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a 
    creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on 
    observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, 
    class, or hit points.
    
    A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is 
    cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component 
    used to create it.
    
    You can use a particular special component to create only 
    one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the 
    target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

    command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the 
    likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would
     draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, 
    Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You 
    make the check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. Ifyour check 
    fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the
