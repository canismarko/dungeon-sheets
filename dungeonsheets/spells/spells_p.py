    your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only 
    to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or

    The target can use its action to examine the

    If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and
     the spell ends.
    
    While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the
     phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes 
    from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk 
    across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the 
    bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge 
    exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fallÂ—it was pushed, it 
    slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
    
    An affected target is so 
    convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the 
    illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. 
    Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can 
    burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic 
    damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the 
    phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could 
    logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as

    making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a 
    specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to 
    request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's 
    choice).
    
    When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any 
    particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for 
    payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from 
    simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on 
    our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able 
    to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.
    
    Payment can take 
    a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or 
    magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice 
    or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest 
    undertaken by you.
    
    As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes 
    requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 
    1,000 gp per hour. And a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 
    gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under 
    which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the 
    payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require 
    only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require 
    a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
    
    After the 
    creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service 
    expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if 
    appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price

    feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thickÂ—centered on a point you can seewithin 
    range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in 
    diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place 
    for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space 
    occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are 
    wasted.
    
    The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light 
    for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast
     the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another 
    creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn 
    there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become 
    blinded for 1 minute.
    
    The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different 
    color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does 
    so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches 
    through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be 
    affected by that layer's properties as described below.
    
    The wall can be 
    destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means 
    specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the 
    duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an 
    antimagic field has no effect on it.
    
    1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire 
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this 
    layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The 
    layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
    
    2. Orange. The
     creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
    successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass 
    through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
    
    3. Yellow. The 
    creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
     a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force 
    damage to it.
    
    4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,
     or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell 
    of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys 
    this layer.
    
    5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or 
    half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing 
    at least 25 fire damage to it.
    
    6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is 
    restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of 
    its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its
     save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the 
    petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; 
    keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer
     is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by 
    bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher 
    level.
    
    7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make 
    a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the
     blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane 
    of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on
     a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are 
    usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a 
    dispel magic spell or similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells
     and magical effects.
