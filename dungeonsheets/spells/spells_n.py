    one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your

    False Aura
    You change the way the target appears to 
    spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You
     can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear 
    nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to 
    a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an 
    object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the 
    item.

    You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects 
    that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a
     sym bol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects 
    treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
