    Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missle and

    The area of another spell or magical effect, 
    such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area

     Any

    Magic Items. 
    The 
    properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. Forexample, a
     +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic 
    weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in 
    the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece 
    of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic

    Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere 
    is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to 
    another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an 
    extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells,

    A creature or 
    object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the 
    sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied
     is no longer withinthe sphere. 
    
    Dispel Magic. 
    Spells and magical effects such

    dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and

    Any 
    creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two
     were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side 
    has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision 
    through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the
     active side faces in a different direction.

    Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating 
    your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition 
    of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails 
    behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to 
    your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your 
    way home. If the cord is cut something that can happen only when an effect 
    specifically states that it does your soul and body are separated, killing you 
    instantly. 
    
    Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can
     pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane
     or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body 
    and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter 
    your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate 
    incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on 
    your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. The spell ends 
    for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the 
    spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. 
    
    
    The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful
     dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for 
    that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit 
    points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord 
    is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending 
    its state of suspended animation. If you are returned to your body prematurely, 
    your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to
     their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.
