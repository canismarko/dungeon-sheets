    You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the

    touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, 
    approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that 
    holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are 
    opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or 
    reading the glyph.
    
    You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated
     only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical 
    characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the 
    ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify

    Fear
    Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened 
    for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is
     holding and must move at least 20 feet away from the glyph on each of ist 
    turns, if able. 
    
    Hopelessness
    Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On
