    conceal the glyph.
    If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the 
    surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object
     must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where 
    you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being 
    triggered.
    
    The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence
     (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
    
    You decide what 
    triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, 
    the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing 
    another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the 
    glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs 
    inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that 
    object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or 
    reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
    
    You can further 
    refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or 
    according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind 
    (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or 
    alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the 
    glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
    
    When you inscribe the glyph, 
    choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.
    
    Explosive Runes
    When triggered, the 
    glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the 
    glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a 
    Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or 
    thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph),
     or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
    Spell Glyph
    You can store a 
    prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of 
    creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The 
    spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph
     is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets 
    the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is
     centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates 
    harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and

    turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet 
    away from you in a direction following the line.
    
    Any creature in the line must 
    spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
    
    
    The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and 
    similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as 
    those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish 
    them.
    
    As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can 
    change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
