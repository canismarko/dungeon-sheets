    the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.
    
    **Targeted Effects** Spells and other magical effects, such as Magic
    Missile and Charm Person, that target a creature or an object in
    the sphere have no effect on that target.
    
    **Areas of Magic** The area of another spell or magical effect,
    such as Fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere
    overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by
    the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a
    Wall of Fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in
    the wall if the overlap is large enough.
    
    **Spells** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature
    or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or
    object is in it.
    
    **Magic Items** The properties and powers of magic items are
    suppressed in the sphere. For example, a + 1 longsword in the
    sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.
    
    A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is
    used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in
    the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully
    leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw
    a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
    item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

    point for such magical travel. A portal to another location,
    world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an
    extradimensional space such as that created by the Rope Trick

    **Creatures and Objects** A creature or object summoned or created
    by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a
    creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied
    is no longer within the sphere.

    The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your
    hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It
    has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand
    doesn't fill its space.  When you cast the spell and as a bonus
    action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60
    feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.
    
    **Clenched Fist** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5
    feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game
    statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.
    
    **Forceful Hand** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5
    feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's
    Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the
    target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on
    the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet
    plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting
    ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within
    5 feet of it.
    
    **Grasping Hand** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller
    creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to
    resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have
    advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target,
    you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do
    so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your
    spellcasting ability modifier.
    
    **Interposing Hand** The hand interposes itself between you and a
    creature you choose until you give the hand a different
    command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target,
    providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't
    move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than
    or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is
    higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward
    you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain
    for the target.
    
    **At Higher Levels** When you cast this spell using a spell slot
    of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option
    increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases
    by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

    examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
    against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target
    realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell
    ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats
    the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any
    illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For
    example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge
    that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the
    target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists
    and comes up with some other explanation for its fall-it was
    pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
    
    An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that
    it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to
    appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm
    created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the
    target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic
    damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5
    feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature
    or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by
    attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate
    to the illusion.

    **Familiarity** “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation
    circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means
    that you possess an object taken from the desired destination
    within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s
    library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a
    lich’s secret tomb.
    
    “Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you
    have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the
    spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once
    but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place
    you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place
    whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s
    description, perhaps from a map.
    
    “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you
    tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion,
    or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no
    longer exists.
    
    **On Target.** You and
    your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
    
    **Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a
    random distance away from the destination in a random
    direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the
    distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to
    travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the
    two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18
    miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by
    rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as
    east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were
    teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea,
    you could be in trouble.
    
    **Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind
    up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to
    the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for
    example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an
    alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and
    implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the
    closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you
    could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
    
    **Mishap.** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult
    journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes
    3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where
    you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each
    time).
