    turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a −10
    penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next
    turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either 4 voluntarily
    or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if
    any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.

    If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain
    motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected

    creature of the natural world.

    With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and
    fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your
    faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the
    following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant
    weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of
    these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types
    of creatures would logically be present in the area.

    At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the
    benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal
    companion at a time.

    If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows
    you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp
    worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit
    and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal
    companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its
    body.

    If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while
    you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and
    is replaced by the restored companion

    The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative
    like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions,
    attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion
    acts on its own. When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your
    animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.

    Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part
    by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its
    own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus,
    an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its
    damage rolls.

    Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It
    also becomes proficient with all saving throws. For each level you gain
    after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases
    its hit points accordingly. Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement
    class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can
    increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two
    ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't
    increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its
    description specifies otherwise.

    flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion
