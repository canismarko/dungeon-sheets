class WildShape(Feature):
    """Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
    shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
    twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your
    druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the
    Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any
    beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a
    flying or swimming speed.

    2nd Level: Max CR 1/4, No Flying/Swimming (ex: Wolf)
    
    4th Level: Max CR 1/2, No Flying (ex: Crocodile)

    8th Level: Max CR 1 (ex: Giant Eagle)

    You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your
    druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you
    expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form
    earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if
    you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

    While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

    • Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but
    you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
    Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
    proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
    creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is
    higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the
    creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.

    • When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When
    you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you
    had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping
    to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For
    example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point
    left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't
    reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

    • You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that
    requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast
    form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've
    already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of
    a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.

    • You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other
    source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing
    so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvi-
    sion, unless your new form also has that sense.

    • You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
    merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
    normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear
    a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your
    equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any
    equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or
    merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you
    leave the form.
