    **Trick Shots**: You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are
    detailed under "Trick Shots" below.  If you have not already, add them by
    name to "features" in your character's .py file.

    Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Each use of a trick shot must
    be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot
    per attack.

    You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and
    18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one
    trick shot you know with a different one.
    
    Grit. You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier
    (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on
    the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a
    firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion). You regain
    all expended grit points after a short or long rest.

    Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a
    saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is
    calculated as follows:

    Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

    Firearm Properties Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such
    bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are
    followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property
    (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in
    the Dungeon Master's Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

    Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score
    before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one
    free hand to reload a firearm.

    Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll
    is equal to or lower than the weapon's Misfire score, the weapon
    misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you
    spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make
    a successful Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your
    check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a
    quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without
    being proficient increase the weapon's misfire score by 1.

    Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a
    Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
    Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the
    ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

    Ammunition All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to
    their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or
    purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition
    yourself using your Tinker's Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its
    own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed
    below next to the price.
